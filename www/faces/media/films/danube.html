			In <i>Danube Hospital</i>, sci-fi and avant-garde meet modern medicine. The setting is Austria&#39s Donauspital, where birth, death, and gore constitute day-to-day activity. Geyrhalter&#39s exquisite shot-compositions aestheticize each unit of the hospital microcosm. One might forget that what they are seeing is documentary footage&#150;imagery of robot-like transporters and state-of-the-art computer technology echo futuristi each is interdependent on the rest, and functions as an integral combination of human and machine. Media screens play a significant role	&#150;it is, after all, through television monitors that we view the stitching of internal organs and an eye surgery. Media is not merely a commercial entity or art form&#150<i>Danube Hospital</i> illustrates its scientific function, its penetration into multiple realms of the contemporary, digitized era. 
			<br><br>
			<i>Danube Hospital</i> will be preceded by a showing of Dr. Paul Goodman&#39s <i>Nurse</i>. <i>Nurse</i> takes us inside Pittsburgh's very own Mercy Hospital. We are introduced to Cheryl Dinardo, a neo-natal nurse who spends long days and nights treating high-risk infants. Even though she deals daily with situations of life or death, Cheryl remains optimistic and truly devoted to her work.
