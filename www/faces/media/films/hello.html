			Gabriela and Gabriel are in a dull and passionless marriage. Using online chatrooms, they both find excitement in sharing personal and intimate details about their lives with a complete stranger. The funny thing is that Gabriela and Gabriel are unknowingly talking to each other. Throughout the movie, their teenage son, Vladimir, provides his own comical commentary about his personal struggles and his thoughts about his parents. This film is a refreshing take on the humorously unpredictable nature of love, relationships, and life.
