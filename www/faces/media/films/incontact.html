			The age of social networking and reality TV brings new meaning to the term "intimacy." <i>InContact</I> depicts the interconnected lives of Gen and Christina, two young women "signed-in" to a world of simultaneous performance and spectatorship. Gen and Christina connect through the online social platform "InContact", which broadcasts its users' daily experiences over a series of live video feeds. Director Ann Oren invites the audience into this voyeuristic world as we, like the characters, sit back and watch as tensions rise and drama unfolds through the eyes of social media.
