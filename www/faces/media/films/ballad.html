			Genesis Breyer P-Orridge is an innovative English rocker and the heralded founder of "industrial music". A self-described "cultural engineer", s/he is also a widely influential avant-garde performance artist. This gorgeously shot documentary is a glimpse into the life of Genesis and h/er love, Lady Jaye Breyer P-Orridge. Their story is an inspiring tale of total, all-consuming love. Director Marie Losier follows the couple around their New York City community with a 16 mm handheld camera, providing a heartfelt look into the artistic experiment that defied biology and challenged preconceived notions of love and partnership. Genesis and Lady Jaye's sexually transformative "Pandrogyne" project is the ultimate act of devotion. The lovers sacrifice their individuality to create a new, unified being - a product of cosmetic surgery, fearless self-expression, and above all, love.
