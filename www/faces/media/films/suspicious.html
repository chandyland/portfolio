			A shy young man named Albert seeks love online and, while surfing the net, stumbles upon Basia. Each employs the same dating strategy-- Basia claims to be a mysterious woman named Simone while Albert poses as handsome French beau. The pair maintains this facade until their first date in "real life," at which point both send an attractive replacement to act on their behalf. However, this carefully orchestrated plan quickly unravels as the group is joined by a ludicrous gang of thieves hunting for a priceless diamonds collection. In this farcical comedy of errors, nobody knows who is in love and who is a suspect!
