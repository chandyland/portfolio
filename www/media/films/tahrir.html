			Experience the overthrow of a 30-year regime of oppression, corruption, and abuse in Stefano Savona's documentary, <i>Tahir: Liberation Square</I>. Savona introduces us to young Egyptians who, day by day, come to the Square, chanting, marching and discussing the bright future of a free Egypt. We feel their exhilaration during an inspirational speech by Google executive Wael Ghonim, whose Facebook page helped spark the revolution. We feel their anger as an ex-convict admits that Mubarak hired prisoners as thugs to quell the demonstrators. We want to chant along with them, "The people want the fall of the regime," and "Mubarak belongs in a sarcophagus with the pharaohs." Those who come to the Square come from all different backgrounds; some are college students, some are peasants, and some are mothers. But they are united in solidarity for one purpose: freedom.
