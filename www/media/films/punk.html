			At a time when the mentally handicapped are still fighting for representation and regard in society, four rockers take solace in an alternative culture that celebrates misfits. <i>The Punk Syndrome</I>, directed by Jukka K&auml;rkk&auml;inen and J-P Passi, is a documentary about a mentally challenged punk band, Perti Kurikka's Name Day, currently climbing its way to popularity in Finland. The film divulges little information about each member's disability, allowing us to focus on the band's day-to-day experiences and passion for honest punk music. Amidst practice jams, touring, and an upcoming album release, each member provides insight into his life's complexities. As <i>The Punk Syndrome</i> thoughtfully illustrates, we all deal with the same human emotions: love, loss, joy, and frustration, to name a few. This film is a thrilling and graceful look at Perti Kurikka's Name Day - a band that shows no sign of giving up or letting down.
