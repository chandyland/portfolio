			<i>Back to the Square</i> is a powerful documentary that reveals citizens' continuing struggles following the fall of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Roughly six months after the "Facebook Revolution," Director Petr Lom explores the lives of five seemingly unrelated people and, doing so, addresses larger issues plaguing the nation. A poor, illiterate horse herdsman struggles against political manipulation. A rural woman is forced to contend with tremendous sexual discrimination. A taxi driver relays his brutal experience in prison as a victim of police corruption. We start to ask ourselves the question: did the "Facebook Revolution" celebrated by international medias bring freedom to Egyptians, or just replace one oppressed society with another?
