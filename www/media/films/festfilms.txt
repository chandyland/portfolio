			<I>Abendland</I> takes us behind the scenes of European nightlife -- into a multitude of nighttime settings from a rave, to a hospital, to a porn-shoot, to an airport bathroom. Europe is presented as a fragmented yet cohesive whole, bound together by machine technology. Surveillance is the motif that ties together a variety of seemingly unrelated situations. Director Geyrhalter pays particular attention to London street cameras, meticulously monitored by a team of government employees. Voyeuristic shots are not limited to acts of deviance or crime; rather, the camera shows us people and places that cinematic representations tend to miss. <I>Abendland</I> is a self-reflexive collage examining the complex ways in which media communications help to ensure national security.

			<i>Back to the Square</i> is a powerful documentary that reveals citizens' continuing struggles following the fall of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Roughly six months after the "Facebook Revolution," Director Petr Lom explores the lives of five seemingly unrelated people and, doing so, addresses larger issues plaguing the nation. A poor, illiterate horse herdsman struggles against political manipulation. A rural woman is forced to contend with tremendous sexual discrimination. A taxi driver relays his brutal experience in prison as a victim of police corruption. We start to ask ourselves the question: did the "Facebook Revolution" celebrated by international medias bring freedom to Egyptians, or just replace one oppressed society with another?

			Genesis Breyer P-Orridge is an innovative English rocker and the heralded founder of "industrial music". A self-described "cultural engineer", s/he is also a widely influential avant-garde performance artist. This gorgeously shot documentary is a glimpse into the life of Genesis and h/er love, Lady Jaye Breyer P-Orridge. Their story is an inspiring tale of total, all-consuming love. Director Marie Losier follows the couple around their New York City community with a 16 mm handheld camera, providing a heartfelt look into the artistic experiment that defied biology and challenged preconceived notions of love and partnership. Genesis and Lady Jaye's sexually transformative "Pandrogyne" project is the ultimate act of devotion. The lovers sacrifice their individuality to create a new, unified being - a product of cosmetic surgery, fearless self-expression, and above all, love.

			Mainstream film introduced us to the corrupt world of the blood diamond industry in Africa, but rarely do we hear about the equally coveted African conflict minerals that hide in our cell phones and other favorite electronics. Concerned citizen and Danish filmmaker Frank Poulsen journeys down the mines in the eastern DR Congo to investigate the illegal coltan and cassiterite mining industry that is financing the country’s civil war. His shocking revelation leads him on a campaign to challenge the ethics and accountability of global cell phone companies like Nokia. The socially responsible consumer will not want to miss this film that reveals how the demand for greater communication in the globalized world is fueling one of the bloodiest wars in history.

			To build China's first global Internet company, Alibaba Group, entrepreneur Jack Ma battles the U.S. online giant, eBay. <i>Crocodile in the Yangtze</I> is an independent memoir written, directed, and produced by Porter Erisman, an American who worked in Ma's company for eight years. The film captures the emotional ups and downs of life in a Chinese Internet startup at a time when the Internet brought China face-to-face with the West. Erisman presents a strikingly candid portrait of Ma and his company, told from the perspective of an "American fly on a Chinese wall" who witnessed the successes and the mistakes Alibaba encountered as it grew from a small apartment into a global company employing more than 16,000 people.

			<br><b>Pittsburgh Premiere</b> <br>
			<br>
			"Geyrhalter's tripod-mounted, impeccably-framed images capture the interactions of human and machine that have come to define the hospital experience in the 21st century"
									   - The Hollywood Reporter
			<br><br>
			<b>Awards</b>
			<br><br>
			*Nominated for 2012 East Silver Caravan (Prague) Silver Eye Award
			<br><br><br>

			In <i>Danube Hospital</i>, sci-fi and avant-garde meet modern medicine. The setting is Austria's Donauspital, where birth, death, and gore constitute day-to-day activity. Geyrhalter’s exquisite shot-compositions aestheticize each unit of the hospital microcosm. One might forget that what they are seeing is documentary footage—imagery of robot-like transporters and state-of-the-art computer technology echo futuristic, science fiction films of the past century (think 2001: <i>A Space Odyssey</i>, but the spaceship is actually a hospital). Scenes of meat-cutting in the cafeteria and in the cadaver-dissection room evoke the same horror. No unit is granted too much camera time; each is interdependent on the rest, and functions as an integral combination of human and machine. Media screens play a significant role—it is, after all, through television monitors that we view the stitching of internal organs and an eye surgery. Media is not merely a commercial entity or art form—<i>Danube Hospital</i> illustrates its scientific function, its penetration into multiple realms of the contemporary, digitized era. 
			<br><br>
			<i>Danube Hospital</i> will be preceded by a showing of Dr. Paul Goodman's <i>Nurse</i>. <i>Nurse</i> takes us inside Pittsburgh's very own Mercy Hospital. We are introduced to Cheryl Dinardo, a neo-natal nurse who spends long days and nights treating high-risk infants. Even though she deals daily with situations of life or death, Cheryl remains optimistic and truly devoted to her work.

			Fame: we all dream about it at some point in life. Whether it's walking on the red carpet or performing on stage in front of a screaming crowd, the idea of fame is something our culture has put on a pedestal. It's easy to forget that behind the glitz and glamor, there is diligence, discipline, and perseverance.  <i>Fame High</i> follows a group of students from the Los Angeles County High School of the Arts (LACHSA) as they encounter adversity, heartache, growth, and triumph. Director Scott Hamilton Kennedy brilliantly sheds light on the reality of what these student artists undergo to pursue their dreams.

			We watched the news headlines as a nation's youth took to the streets to demand justice. We added a ribbon to our Twitter defaults to show support for the protesters. This is not the story of Egypt, Libya, or Syria, but of the movement that started it all: the Green Revolution in Iran. An anonymous filmmaker living virtually in Iran tells the story of the 2009-2010 election protests by sharing with us his personal archives of YouTube videos, tweets, emails, and other brief clips of the chaos that authorities tried to shield from our eyes. Like Anonymous, we travel to the streets of Tehran through social media channels and return to reality with a new sense of what it means to be countless but to still count.

			Gabriela and Gabriel are in a dull and passionless marriage. Using online chatrooms, they both find excitement in sharing personal and intimate details about their lives with a complete stranger. The funny thing is that Gabriela and Gabriel are unknowingly talking to each other. Throughout the movie, their teenage son, Vladimir, provides his own comical commentary about his personal struggles and his thoughts about his parents. This film is a refreshing take on the humorously unpredictable nature of love, relationships, and life.

			At a time when the mentally handicapped are still fighting for representation and regard in society, four rockers take solace in an alternative culture that celebrates misfits. <i>The Punk Syndrome</I>, directed by Jukka K&auml;rkk&auml;inen and J-P Passi, is a documentary about a mentally challenged punk band, Perti Kurikka's Name Day, currently climbing its way to popularity in Finland. The film divulges little information about each member's disability, allowing us to focus on the band's day-to-day experiences and passion for honest punk music. Amidst practice jams, touring, and an upcoming album release, each member provides insight into his life's complexities. As <i>The Punk Syndrome</i> thoughtfully illustrates, we all deal with the same human emotions: love, loss, joy, and frustration, to name a few. This film is a thrilling and graceful look at Perti Kurikka's Name Day - a band that shows no sign of giving up or letting down.

			Even if you do not speak Japanese, you are probably familiar with the mouth-watering word, "sushi." In this documentary, Director Mark Hall guides us through the fascinating world of the global sushi phenomenon. From testimonies by renowned sushi masters in urban Tokyo to fish traders from the vibrant Tsukiji Market, <i>Sushi</I> illustrates determination and professionalism in Japanese culture through this highly industrialized food empire. Traveling to different countries around the globe, Hall examines how sushi becomes integrated into local cultures. While creating an astonishing visual feast, Hall also raises the concern about the industry's sustainability. As the demand for sushi skyrockets, overfishing in certain areas is decreasing supply. This documentary is a delicious, thought-provoking exploration of the state—and future—of the global sushi industry.

			Mark Hall is an independent filmmaker based in Austin, Texas. <i>Sushi: The Global Catch</i> is his first feature-length film project – which was conceived while visiting Warsaw, Poland. Mark was amazed by the popularity of sushi in eastern Europe and viewed the cuisine as emblematic of how economies have rapidly globalized. He was a part of the 'early' days of the Internet, having established the world's largest online education portal in 1998. Mark's experience in media – along with his background in business and law – was a big help in completing <i>Sushi</I>. He attended graduate school in Japan and loves sushi.	<a href="https://twitter.com/SakanaFilms" target="_blank">@sakanafilms</a>

			A shy young man named Albert seeks love online and, while surfing the net, stumbles upon Basia. Each employs the same dating strategy-- Basia claims to be a mysterious woman named Simone while Albert poses as handsome French beau. The pair maintains this facade until their first date in "real life," at which point both send an attractive replacement to act on their behalf. However, this carefully orchestrated plan quickly unravels as the group is joined by a ludicrous gang of thieves hunting for a priceless diamonds collection. In this farcical comedy of errors, nobody knows who is in love and who is a suspect!

			Experience the overthrow of a 30-year regime of oppression, corruption, and abuse in Stefano Savona's documentary, <i>Tahir: Liberation Square</I>. Savona introduces us to young Egyptians who, day by day, come to the Square, chanting, marching and discussing the bright future of a free Egypt. We feel their exhilaration during an inspirational speech by Google executive Wael Ghonim, whose Facebook page helped spark the revolution. We feel their anger as an ex-convict admits that Mubarak hired prisoners as thugs to quell the demonstrators. We want to chant along with them, "The people want the fall of the regime," and "Mubarak belongs in a sarcophagus with the pharaohs." Those who come to the Square come from all different backgrounds; some are college students, some are peasants, and some are mothers. But they are united in solidarity for one purpose: freedom.

			"...an idiosyncratic, funny, unexpectedly poignant snapshot of American youth" – <I>The Hollywood Reporter</I>
			<br><br><br>

			This film opens with group of Bronx teenagers boarding a city bus on the last day of school. Before you get too comfortable, rest assured: this is not a sugar-coated high school drama, or a romantic coming-of-age story. <i>The We and the I</I> is a brutally honest portrayal of teenage interactions and the increasing desensitization that surrounds them. The bus is a micro community, and the students are left to their own devices within its confines. They can gossip, flirt, intimidate, deride, humiliate, and alienate as they please. But as the passenger count dwindles, the group dynamic changes and relationships evolve. Director Michel Gondry delivers an artful foray into a world that devalues sincerity and begs for incessant stimulation. <i>The We and the I</I> is truthful, alarming, and absolutely relevant.

			Born in Versailles in 1963, French writer-director Michel Gondry launched into the industry by way of a Bj&ouml;rk music video collaboration. A subsequent slew of music video and commercial work helped Gondry gain respect for the experimental and technologically complex bent of his productions and he made the move to feature filmmaking in 2001. His second feature, <I>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</I> (2004), earned him a Best Original Screenplay Oscar and cemented his status as an auteur with a flair for the witty and surreal. His filmography includes quirky works like <I>The Science of Sleep</I> (2006) and <I>Be Kind Rewind</I> (2008).

			What happens when money is more powerful than people? In 2006, Donald Trump purchased an estate on the northeast coast of Scotland, planning to build a complex of golf courses, luxury flats, and a grand hotel. The local council rejected his proposal on account of its threat the area's precious, endangered ecosystem. However, the Scottish government overturned the decision and gave a green light to the development of the complex. This documentary explores the controversy that arose in the wake of this devastating decision and the 21st Century David and Goliath battle that ensued. <I>You've Been Trumped</I> is an entertaining, inspiring, and occasionally disturbing parable of our times and values.
