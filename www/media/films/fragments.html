			We watched the news headlines as a nation's youth took to the streets to demand justice. We added a ribbon to our Twitter defaults to show support for the protesters. This is not the story of Egypt, Libya, or Syria, but of the movement that started it all: the Green Revolution in Iran. An anonymous filmmaker living virtually in Iran tells the story of the 2009-2010 election protests by sharing with us his personal archives of YouTube videos, tweets, emails, and other brief clips of the chaos that authorities tried to shield from our eyes. Like Anonymous, we travel to the streets of Tehran through social media channels and return to reality with a new sense of what it means to be countless but to still count.

			<b>About the Director</b>
			<br><br>
			"Ana Nyma" is a pseudonym used for this movie, because of evident political reasons. Moreover, to echo the thousands of anonymous authors of the images from Iran, the team of the movie wishes to remain anonymous.
