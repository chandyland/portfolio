			Genesis Breyer P-Orridge is an innovative English rocker and the heralded founder of "industrial music". A self-described "cultural engineer", s/he is also a widely influential avant-garde performance artist. This gorgeously shot documentary is a glimpse into the life of Genesis and h/er love, Lady Jaye Breyer P-Orridge. Their story is an inspiring tale of total, all-consuming love. Director Marie Losier follows the couple around their New York City community with a 16 mm handheld camera, providing a heartfelt look into the artistic experiment that defied biology and challenged preconceived notions of love and partnership. Genesis and Lady Jaye's sexually transformative "Pandrogyne" project is the ultimate act of devotion. The lovers sacrifice their individuality to create a new, unified being - a product of cosmetic surgery, fearless self-expression, and above all, love.

			Marie Losier was born in France in 1972, where she went on to study literature at the University of Nanterre before moving to New York City to focus on Fine Art. Her films, described as "whimsical, poetic, dreamlike, and unconventional," often showcase the creative spirit of avant-garde personalities. Losier's works have been featured at numerous festivals and museums around the world, including the Tribeca Film Festival, SXSW, Tate Modern, and the Centre George Pompidou. Losier has served as the film curator at the French Institute Alliance Fran&ccedil;aise (FIAF) since 2000.
