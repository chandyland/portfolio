			To build China's first global Internet company, Alibaba Group, entrepreneur Jack Ma battles the U.S. online giant, eBay. <i>Crocodile in the Yangtze</I> is an independent memoir written, directed, and produced by Porter Erisman, an American who worked in Ma's company for eight years. The film captures the emotional ups and downs of life in a Chinese Internet startup at a time when the Internet brought China face-to-face with the West. Erisman presents a strikingly candid portrait of Ma and his company, told from the perspective of an "American fly on a Chinese wall" who witnessed the successes and the mistakes Alibaba encountered as it grew from a small apartment into a global company employing more than 16,000 people.

			Porter first landed in China in 1994 and, after a year of Chinese language study, fell into a six-month stint as host of <i>China Through Foreigners' Eyes</i>, a travel program on China Central Television. After studying for an MBA in the United States from 1996-1998, Porter returned to China and worked at Ogilvy & Mather in Beijing, overseeing an Internet marketing group as China's Internet began to take off. Porter joined Alibaba.com in April 2000, just as the company moved out of a small apartment. From 2000-2008, Porter worked as a Vice-President at Alibaba.com and Alibaba Group, at various times leading the company's international website operations, international marketing and corporate affairs. Porter received a B.A. in Political Science from Stanford University and an MBA from the Kellogg Graduate School of Management. Additional studies include courses at the Beijing Language University and the New York Film Academy. <i>Crocodile in the Yangtze</I> is Porter's first film.
