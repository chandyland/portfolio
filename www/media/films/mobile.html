			Mainstream film introduced us to the corrupt world of the blood diamond industry in Africa, but rarely do we hear about the equally coveted African conflict minerals that hide in our cell phones and other favorite electronics. Concerned citizen and Danish filmmaker Frank Poulsen journeys down the mines in the eastern DR Congo to investigate the illegal coltan and cassiterite mining industry that is financing the country's civil war. His shocking revelation leads him on a campaign to challenge the ethics and accountability of global cell phone companies like Nokia. The socially responsible consumer will not want to miss this film that reveals how the demand for greater communication in the globalized world is fueling one of the bloodiest wars in history.
