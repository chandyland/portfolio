			Fame: we all dream about it at some point in life. Whether it's walking on the red carpet or performing on stage in front of a screaming crowd, the idea of fame is something our culture has put on a pedestal. It's easy to forget that behind the glitz and glamor, there is diligence, discipline, and perseverance.  <i>Fame High</i> follows a group of students from the Los Angeles County High School of the Arts (LACHSA) as they encounter adversity, heartache, growth, and triumph. Director Scott Hamilton Kennedy brilliantly sheds light on the reality of what these student artists undergo to pursue their dreams.

			Academy Award nominee Scott Hamilton Kennedy is a writer, director, producer, cameraman, and editor. He has worked on a diverse range of projects, including music videos, commercials, motion capture animation, scripted and reality television, and fiction and non-fiction film. We first welcomed him to the Carnegie Mellon International Film Festival in 2009 when he premiered his Oscar-nominated Best Documentary feature, The Garden. Scott's ability to create potent human dramas through the medium of film make him a perfect recurring guest director at our festival and at award ceremonies worldwide.
