			<h2>Who We Are</h2>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="text">
					<h3>Background</h3>
					In March 2011, Jacob Buckman and Tony Pezzullo, then high school juniors, received their final SAT scores. When they heard of their friends' struggles with the testing process, they decided they wanted to help. On that day, Stonehill SAT Tutoring was born. Stonehill wants to give back to the community from which it came. Our goal is to help local students succeed on standardized testing by tutoring them at unprecedentedly low rates, the company remains true to that mission, servicing students throughout Monmouth, Mercer, Middlesex, and Ocean counties. We will not be satisfied until every student in central New Jersey has the scores to get them into the college of their dreams!

					<h3>Testimonials</h3>
					"I could not have been more impressed with the dedication and professionalism of the tutors at Stonehill SAT Tutoring. I was extremely satisfied with my experience and would highly recommend them for your son or daughter to help improve their SAT scores. Each of the tutors have near perfect scores themselves, so why look any further?  They are more than qualified to give any extra help that is needed. Just give them a try and you will instantly see that you made the right choice!  Their price is very reasonable and the rewards, priceless!" - <i>Maureen Schneider, Parent</i> 
					<br>
					<br>
					"I had a great experience with Stonehill SAT tutoring. Tony was a very professional and personal tutor who not only taught me many new skills, but also gave me much needed confidence before the test. He was also very accommodating to my busy schedule and I always felt that I was a priority in his schedule as well. You really get out of tutoring what you put into it, and Tony was there for me every step of the way. In the end, Tony greatly helped me improve my score and helped me to become a much better test taker." - <i> Tom DiBella, Student</i>
